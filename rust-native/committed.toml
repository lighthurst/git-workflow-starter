# committed.toml - Conventional commit message validation
# https://github.com/crate-ci/committed

# This enforces conventional commits format:
#   type(scope): description
#
# Example valid commits:
#   feat(api): add user authentication endpoint
#   fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue
#   chore(deps): update dependencies
